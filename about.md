title: About
---

I like to write software, think about how to effectively build
product, and work with my hands.

I am currently the Director of Engineering at [Parachute
Health](https://parachutehealth.com) and have worked in software
building products for over ten years.

I am an Emacs enthusiast that founded and helps run
[EmacsNYC](https://emacsnyc.org).
