I'm restarting the blog. While I'm unclear if this will work. I want
to try to be writing a bit more about my experiences and opinions. I
have at least one thing I would like to write about, the 1.5 year long
shed project I completed. I think I could talk more about git, Emacs,
software development, management practices, etc.

There is honestly a lot I'd like to get off my chest, but I have to it.

So here it goes.
