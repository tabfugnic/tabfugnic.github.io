title: Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll
summary: "Switching to Jekyll to obtain the power of Git and subsequently being able to use an interface I'm completely familiar with."
---
I'm a bit fed up with wordpress. It's definitely a decent blogging platform, but I've found that I want to be more programmatic. If not programmatic, at least being able to take advantage of things that I use in my day-to-day life, markdown, git and, of course, Emacs. It's not as though I made this decision lightly, there are some distinct advantages I fell in love with.

__Pros__

- Taking full advantage of the power of Git
- No more database, just markdown and generated static HTML
- More control over its location and webserver
- Greatly simplifies content management
- No more WYSIWYG editors, just Emacs and Markdown. What is there not to love?


Needless to say, there are tons of positives I'm looking forward to, but that's not to say there aren't plenty of things I'm going to be missing or even negatives that will come from using a new platform.

__Cons__

- Less mobile. Requiring a computer with this repo and git access
- Not nearly as SEO friendly, but who requires that much SEO


All that said, Jekyll will certainly be an interesting experiment. One I hope will produce more content on my part, but who am I to say? The only thing I can do is try it and see.

If you would like to learn more about Jekyll, take a look at it's [website](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Next post I do I'll see if I can do a quick tutorial.
